Colour-Memory
=============

The goal of this work sample is to construct a sample memory game called ”Colour Memory”. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid with 8 pairs of color cards.

The game starts initially with all cards facing down. The player is to then flip two cards each round, trying to find a match. If the flipped pair is a match, the player receives two (2) points, and the cards may be removed from the game board. Otherwise, the cards are turned face- down again and the player loses one (1) point. This continues until all pairs have been found.

After the game is finished, the user should be prompted to input his name. The user's name and the score would then be stored in a database, and the user should be notified of his score and the current rankings.

The database is hosted in a web server, this web server is programmed with PHP and the data is transferred using web services with json files.
